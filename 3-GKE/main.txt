GKE Cluster Mode

Standard:
    You add your worker nodes to the cluster just like self-managed nodes in AWS
        Zonal cluster: all nodes are in the zone
        Regional cluster: all nodes are spread in multiple zone
        Public cluster: This is in a public subnet
        Private cluster: This is secured, in a private subnet

    You do not need to manage the nodes  just like managed nodes in AWS

     Zonal cluster: all nodes are in the zone
     Regional cluster: all nodes are spread in multiple zone
     Public cluster: This is in a public subnet
     Private cluster: This is secured, in a private subnet
