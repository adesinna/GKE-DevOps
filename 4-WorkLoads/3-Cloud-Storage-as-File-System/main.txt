Fuse is an interface primarily used to export a filesystem to the linux kernel. Cloud Storage FUSE CSI Driver allows
you to mount cloud storage buckets as file system.
Application would do I/O without using google cloud api to consume the objects in the bucket.

1.We need to create a bucket on GCP storage, with some static files.

2. We need to attach a special role to our project, which will reference a namespace and service account


gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding terraform-470417\
    --member='user:adesinagcp@gmail.com' \
    --role='roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin'

 --member "principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog/subject/ns/NAMESPACE/sa/KSA_NAME" \
    --role "ROLE_NAME"

3. Create ns, sa in K8s
