You can use cloud sql, now we would create the database in its own vpc and do a vpc peer with our own infrastructure.

1. First you need to reserve ip in your vpc

2. You need to create a private service connection

3. Create your db

4. exec into the test pod

mysql -h <CLOUD_SQL_PRIVATE_IP> -u umsadmin -p webappdb

# terraform output to see the db ip

enter password
